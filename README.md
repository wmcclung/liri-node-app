# liri-node-app

This is the Liri app. It can be used to call various API's such as spotify,OMDB, and Bandisintown within the node console.

I wasnt able to get the APIs to feed. To continue working and structure how they should console.log I utulized Postman to see how they would display and get the relative path of the fields needed in my API resposne.


Bandisintown

OMDB

The "Do what it says" functionality I found pretty confusing as I couldnt run the require FS to confirm if my method works or not. 

For the spotify app I used a seperate doc to get the relative path of the needed fields in the response and then inserted that into what I believe would work with the structure of the npm node-spotify-api
